# London Trip Research & Schedule Plan (Claude output)

## Trip Window
- **Arrive:** Late Feb 13 (Thursday evening)
- **Full days:** Feb 14 (Sat) - Feb 19 (Thu)
- **Depart:** Feb 20 (Fri) afternoon
- **Valentine's Day:** Feb 14 (Saturday) -- first full day
- **London Fashion Week:** Starts Feb 19 (Thu) -- last full day

## Research Tasks

### 1. Museums -- Hours, Tickets, Crowd Patterns
Research opening hours, free/paid status, and least-crowded days/times for:
- Victoria & Albert Museum
- Tate Modern
- Saatchi Gallery (check "The Long Now" exhibition -- runs through Apr 2026)
- Natural History Museum (check Dinosaurs gallery + special exhibitions)

### 2. Destinations -- Hours, Booking Requirements, Crowd Patterns
- **Tower of London / Yeoman Warder Tours** -- ticket prices, tour times, advance booking
- **Highgate Cemetery** -- tour times, booking, West vs East side access
- **Camden Market** -- opening hours, busiest vs quietest days
- **God's Own Junkyard** -- open Fri-Sun only, in Walthamstow (further out)
- **Sky Garden** -- free but requires advance booking, check ticket availability for Feb dates
- **Outernet London** -- free immersive screens near Tottenham Court Rd, open daily

### 3. RSC Ghost & Gore Tour
- Confirm location (likely Stratford-upon-Avon, ~2hrs by train)
- Check if tours run during the Feb 14-19 window
- Only include if it fits without burning a full day awkwardly

### 4. Restaurants & Pubs -- Reservation Needs
- **Pravaas** -- Valentine's Day menu (book ASAP for Feb 14)
- **Kettner's** (Soho House) -- likely needs reservation, check member requirements
- **Duck & Waffle** -- 24hr restaurant, popular, likely needs reservation
- **Darwin's at Sky Garden** -- combine with Sky Garden visit
- **Lost Souls Pizza** -- vampire pizza bar, check if reservations needed
- **Ducksoup** -- small Soho spot, likely needs reservation

### 5. Events & What's On
- Check Time Out London and Halibuts for concerts/events during Feb 14-20
- London Fashion Week (Feb 19-23) -- mostly industry/invite-only, but check for public events or atmosphere around The Strand/180 Strand

### 6. Low Priority / If Time Permits
- The Troubadour
- Dead Man's Hole (historical site, quick visit)

## Schedule Strategy

Key scheduling constraints to optimize around:
- **Valentine's Day (Sat Feb 14):** Reserve for a special dinner (Pravaas V-day menu). Daytime can be lighter/romantic activity.
- **Weekdays (Mon-Thu) are best for:** Tower of London (Tue-Thu mornings least crowded), Natural History Museum, museums in general
- **Weekend days (Sat-Sun):** Better for markets, neighborhoods, restaurants that may have special brunch/weekend menus
- **Friday Feb 14 evening arrival** means Feb 14 morning could start slowly (jet lag?)
- **God's Own Junkyard:** Only open Fri-Sun, so must be Feb 14, 15, or 20 -- and it's in Walthamstow (30min from central London)
- **Sky Garden:** Book free tickets in advance; combine with Darwin's restaurant
- **Feb 20 (Fri, departure day):** Half day only -- keep to something near hotel or easy/light
- **Geographic clustering:** Group nearby attractions on the same day to minimize transit

# Must-See Sights Not on Our Itinerary

## Things You'll Literally Walk Past

These are on existing routes -- you'd pass them without a detour:

- **Tower Bridge** -- Right next to the Tower of London (Tue). Walkway above has glass floors. Free to walk across, £12.30 for the exhibition/engine rooms.
- **St Paul's Cathedral** -- Between the Tower and Sky Garden on your Tue route. Even just the exterior is striking. Interior £23, free for services.
- **Millennium Bridge** -- Connects Tate Modern to St Paul's. You'll probably cross it on Mon without realizing.
- **Shakespeare's Globe** -- Literally next door to Tate Modern. Tours available if interested (~£20).
- **National Portrait Gallery** -- The Lucian Freud exhibition is already in our events list, but NPG isn't on the venue list. Right at Trafalgar Square, short walk from Soho on Mon afternoon.

## Matches Our Vibe But Not on the List

- **Dennis Severs' House** (Spitalfields) -- A candlelit 18th-century time capsule. Silent walk-through. One of the most unusual experiences in London. Near the Tower/City area, could fit on Tue. ~£15, book ahead.
- **Columbia Road Flower Market** -- Sunday mornings only (8am-3pm). In East London near Viktor Wynd/Hackney. Could work as a quick stop before God's Own Junkyard on Sun.
- **Brick Lane / Shoreditch street art** -- East London, near Viktor Wynd. Street art, vintage shops, curry houses, Beigel Bake (24hr bagel shop, London institution).
- **Maltby Street Market** -- Smaller, less touristy alternative to Borough Market. Saturday mornings, under railway arches near London Bridge.
- **The Barbican Centre** -- Brutalist architecture, conservatory (free, tropical greenhouse inside concrete), art gallery. Near the City.

## Classic Sights You Might Regret Skipping

- **Westminster / Big Ben / Houses of Parliament** -- Even if you don't go inside anything, a 20-minute walk along the Thames past Westminster is iconic. Churchill War Rooms (✓ now added to Mon) is nearby.
- **Trafalgar Square / National Gallery** -- ✓ Now added to Mon schedule as optional add-on. Free and world-class.
- **Kew Gardens** -- The Orchid Festival is already in our events. It's out in Richmond (30min from central) but the festival is genuinely special. Could replace a lighter afternoon.

## Near Existing Stops, Easy Add-Ons

- **Science Museum** -- Right next to V&A and NHM in South Kensington. Free. If you have time on departure morning (Fri).
- **Covent Garden** -- Between Soho and the South Bank. Street performers, market halls, food. 10-minute walk from Outernet.
- **Portobello Road Market** -- Notting Hill, Saturdays are busiest. Antiques, vintage, food. If Feb 14 (Sat) feels too light.

## Probably Skip (Tourist Traps / Not Our Vibe)

- London Eye (expensive queue for a Ferris wheel)
- Madame Tussauds
- Buckingham Palace exterior (just a gate and a crowd)
- Platform 9¾ (long queue for a photo)

## Top 3 Recommendations to Add

Based on existing interests (art, music, alternative/quirky culture, history, food):

1. **Dennis Severs' House** -- Could fit on Tue (City day). ~£15, book ahead. Unlike anything else in London.
2. **Columbia Road Flower Market** -- Sun morning before heading to Walthamstow. Free. Beautiful photo ops.
3. **National Portrait Gallery** -- Lucian Freud exhibition. Free general admission. Easy add-on to Mon (Soho day) or any day passing through central.
